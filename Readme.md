The 30-Day JavaScript Challenge is designed to provide a structured and comprehensive approach to mastering JavaScript. Here are the key details of the course:

- **Duration:** 30 days
- **Content:** Core JavaScript concepts, related questions, DSA, and project creation

## Goals for the Challenge

1. **Master Core JavaScript Concepts:** Deep dive into JavaScript fundamentals and advanced topics.
2. **Solve Complex Problems:** Improve my problem-solving skills by tackling related questions and DSA challenges.
3. **Build Real-World Projects:** Apply my knowledge to create projects that can be added to my portfolio.
4. **Engage with the Community:** Share my progress, get feedback, and support fellow learners.

## Daily Progress

I will be updating this repository daily with my progress, including code snippets, projects, and solutions to the challenges I tackle.

## Day 1: Variables & Data Types

On the first day, I learned about variables and data types in JavaScript. Understanding how to declare and use variables, as well as the different types of data (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.), is fundamental to writing effective JavaScript code.

### Key Concepts Covered:

- Variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Primitive data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`
- Non-primitive data types: `object` (including arrays and functions)
